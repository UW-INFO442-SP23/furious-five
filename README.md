Our Mission

The goal for this project is reduce food waste in King County and our solution was to create a website with a food post forum that can help restaurants utilize their food, that will not be used by the restaurants anymore, to reduce food waste. The forum will have information, provided by restaurants, about the food that is being given away or not used, and non-profit organizations can see what food is available for them to get or purchase.
