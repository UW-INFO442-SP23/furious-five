# Furious-Five

## Our Mission

The goal for this project is reduce food waste in King County and our solution was to create a website with a food post forum that can help restaurants utilize their food, that will not be used by the restaurants anymore, to reduce food waste. The forum will have information, provided by restaurants, about the food that is being given away or not used, and non-profit organizations can see what food is available for them to get or purchase.

## Features

- Food Post Forum (Restaurants can input their list of food inventory that they want to give away)
- Login authentication (Restaurants will register their name and information on the website which will be used to login to their page later)

## GitHub Page

The published site can be viewed here: https://github.com/UW-INFO442-SP23/furious-five.git
